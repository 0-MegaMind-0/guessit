Installing GuessIt is simple with `pip <http://www.pip-installer.org/>`_::

    $ pip install guessit

or, with `easy_install <http://pypi.python.org/pypi/setuptools>`_::

    $ easy_install guessit

But, you really `shouldn't do that <http://www.pip-installer.org/en/latest/other-tools.html#pip-compared-to-easy-install>`_.
