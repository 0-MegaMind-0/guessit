class IterativeMatcher(object):
    """An iterative matcher tries to match different patterns that appear
    in the filename.

    The ``filetype`` argument indicates which type of file you want to match.
    If it is ``'autodetect'``, the matcher will try to see whether it can guess
    that the file corresponds to an episode, or otherwise will assume it is
    a movie.

    The recognized ``filetype`` values are:
    ``['autodetect', 'subtitle', 'info', 'movie', 'moviesubtitle', 'movieinfo', 'episode',
    'episodesubtitle', 'episodeinfo']``

    ``opts`` is a list of option names, that act as global flags for the matcher

    ``transformers_options`` is a dict of args to be passed to the transformations used
    by the matcher. Its schema is: ``{ transfo_name: (transfo_args, transfo_kwargs) }``


    The IterativeMatcher works mainly in 2 steps:

    First, it splits the filename into a match_tree, which is a tree of groups
    which have a semantic meaning, such as episode number, movie title,
    etc...

    The match_tree created looks like the following::

      0000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000 111

      0000000000000000000000000000000001111112011112222333333401123334000011233340000000 000
      __________________(The.Prestige).______.[____.HP.______.{__-___}.St{__-___}.Chaps].___
      xxxxxttttttttttttt               ffffff  vvvv    xxxxxx  ll lll     xx xxx         ccc
      [XCT].Le.Prestige.(The.Prestige).DVDRip.[x264.HP.He-Aac.{Fr-Eng}.St{Fr-Eng}.Chaps].mkv

    The first 3 lines indicates the group index in which a char in the
    filename is located. So for instance, ``x264`` (in the middle) is the group (0, 4, 1), and
    it corresponds to a video codec, denoted by the letter ``v`` in the 4th line.
    (for more info, see guess.matchtree.to_string)

    Second, it tries to merge all this information into a single object
    containing all the found properties, and does some (basic) conflict
    resolution when they arise.
